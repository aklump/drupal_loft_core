About anonymous users  Anonymous users are unique by the domain of their email address + their ip.  That is to say that for these three users, only one record will be created (tracked):  | uid | mail | ip | |----------|----------|----------| 0 | a@spammy.com | 172.1.1.1 0 | b@spammy.com | 172.1.1.1 0 | c@spammy.com | 172.1.1.1  This is because all email address share the same domain and the ip is the same from all three.  But in this next set, three entries would be made because the ip is different for two and non-existent for one, despite having the same base domain.  | uid | mail | ip | |----------|----------|----------| 0 | a@spammy.com | 172.1.1.1 0 | b@spammy.com | 172.1.1.2 0 | c@spammy.com | null  Also take note that if the ip is the same but the domain differs, then three records will be tracked:  | uid | mail | ip | |----------|----------|----------| 0 | trouble@spammy.com | 172.1.1.1 0 | trouble@morespam.com | 172.1.1.1 0 | trouble@totalspam.com | 172.1.1.1  To save database, we don't track anonymous users by email address, but by email domain, as this is the most likely reason to track them: to block their entire domain.  Suggested modules to use:  Honeypot  Honeypot rejections will be tracked as \"honey bears\" and can later be converted to \"spammy\" users.  This only works if the $_POST array contains the key mail.  An example is user_register_form, where this works nicely.  Honeybears can be found in the table loft_core_users with a status of LOFT_CORE_USERS_STATUS_HONEYBEAR.  User Restrictions  Blocks users with an email address containing any domains that have been found as \"spammy\".  The list of domains are found in loft_core_users.  Check the status because honeybear domains do not block new users.  Todos   [] batch process to mark all users that match domains or ips in our loft_users_core. [] automatically add to blocked_ips table.

So you could redirect all nodes in a certain bundle to a different page, mark them as access denied or even not found.  It takes the approach of injecting the redirect in node_page_view, rather than invoking something during hook_init(), which should have a lesser footprint.  HOOK_loft_core_redirect_node_BUNDLE_TYPE_view HOOK_loft_core_redirect_node_BUNDLE_TYPE_edit HOOK_loft_core_redirect_node_BUNDLE_TYPE_delete HOOK_loft_core_node_BUNDLE_TYPE_page   If you set his module up to redirect say, blog nodes, then when you create a new blog, using the node edit form, instead of the normal behavior which takes you to the node view page, you will be taken to the node edit page instead.  Otherwise you would have an issue with getting redirected to places you didn't intend, and if the redirect was to another site, then you'd really be confused as an admin.

<h2>Disable elements</h2>

<p>It is nice to be able to keep an element visible, yet disable it.  Making this easy is the goal of <code>loft_core_form_disable_elements()</code>.</p>

<h2>Form help</h2>

<p>This module defines a new element called 'form_help'. It can also take <code>#weight</code> and <code>#attributes</code> (not shown).</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?php
    $form['help'] = [
        '#type'    =&gt; 'form_help',

        // Notice an array, where each value is a separate paragraph and will be themed as such. It does not have to be an array, and passing a string is considered a single paragraph.
        '#message' =&gt; array(
            t("You are editing the template for all user collections."),
            t("When a user account is created, the values of this node at the time the user account is created will be copied to the users's account as a Sample Collection.  Changes made to the node are not retroactive and only affect the user collections created from that point forward."),
        ),
    ];

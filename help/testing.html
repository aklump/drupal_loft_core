<p>Test mode is enabled by default when <code>DRUPAL_ENV</code> does not equal <code>DRUPAL_ENV_PROD</code>.  This means that test classes will be appened to elements whenever the function <code>loft_core_test_class()</code> is used.</p>

<p>When not in test mode, test classes will not be added.</p>

<h2>Testing on Prod</h2>

<p>In order to test against a production environment you need to enable test mode using an endpoint.  You must set up the endpoint with an access key in your settings.php like this:</p>

<pre><code>$conf['loft_core_testing_key'] = '{some obscure public key that will appear in your url}';
</code></pre>

<p>When you visit the url endpoint, include the testing key like so:</p>

<pre><code>/loft-core/testing/enable/{testing key}
</code></pre>

<p>This will enable the test mode for a short duration and cause test classes to appear on production, for your IP only.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>User enters: <code>http://www.mysite.com/some-cool-aliased-title</code></p></li>
<li><p>You want: <code>/node/123</code></p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>loft_core_smart_url</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine an admin entering a link to the site.  As developer want the unaliased relative path, as the admin, they copy and past the absolute aliased path.  It's a pain to explain to theme that they have to convert it to the way you want it, so you give up.  But that's where <code>loft_core_smart_url()</code> comes in.  Hand it the url they entered, and it will give you the url you want.</p>

<p>Add this to a presave hook after collection an url in a node form.</p>

<p>Add this to a filter that can then convert the bad urls to good urls.</p>

<p>Rock.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>This should work out of the box, but to fine tune it add something like the following to <em>settings.php</em>.</p>

<pre><code>$config['loft_core.settings']['smart_url_regex'] = '/mysite.(?:org|loft)$/i';
</code></pre>

<p>Imagine an admin entering a link to the site.  As developer want the unaliased relative path, as the admin, they copy and past the absolute aliased path.  It's a pain to explain to theme that they have to convert it to the way you want it, so you give up.  But that's where <code>loft_core_smart_url()</code> comes in.  Hand it the url they entered, and it will give you the url you want.</p>

<p>Add this to a presave hook after collection an url in a node form.</p>

<p>Add this to a filter that can then convert the bad urls to good urls.</p>

<p>Rock.</p>

# Loft Core

This module contains features that I wish were in core, and which I often use for all my projects.  Documentation can be found at _docs/index.html_ or by using the Advanced Help module.

## Installation

Add the following to _composer.json_ above web root.  Making sure you have done `composer require wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin`

        "merge-plugin": {
            "require": [
                "web/modules/custom/loft_core/composer.json"
            ]
        },

Then do `composer update --lock`.

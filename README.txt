                                   Loft Core

   This module contains features that I wish were in core, and which I
   often use for all my projects. Documentation can be found at
   docs/index.html or by using the Advanced Help module.

Installation

   Add the following to composer.json above web root. Making sure you have
   done composer require wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin
    "merge-plugin": {
        "require": [
            "web/modules/custom/loft_core/composer.json"
        ]
    },

   Then do composer update --lock.

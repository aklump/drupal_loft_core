                                   Loft Core

   This module contains features that I wish were in core, and which I
   often use for all my projects.

Autoloading

   Some features require the autoloading, if you use these features you
   have to enable them. To activate the autoloading feature of this module
   add this to settings.php:
$conf['loft_core_autoload'] = true;

Integrations

  [1]User restrictions

   Automatically trap any new user whose email domain matches that of a
   robo-trapped user.

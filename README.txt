                                   Loft Core

   This module contains features that I wish were in core, and which I
   often use for all my projects. Documentation can be found at
   docs/index.html or by using the Advanced Help module.

Installation

    1. Add the following to the application's composer.json above web
       root.
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "path",
      "url": "web/modules/custom/loft_core"
    }
  ]
}

    2. Now run composer require drupal/loft-core

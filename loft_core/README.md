# Loft Core

This module contains features that I wish were in core, and which I often use for all my projects.  Documentation can be found at _docs/index.html_ or by using the Advanced Help module.

## Installation

1. Add the following to the application's _composer.json_ above web root.

    ```json
    {
      "repositories": [
        {
          "type": "path",
          "url": "web/modules/custom/loft_core"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Now run `composer require drupal/loft-core`

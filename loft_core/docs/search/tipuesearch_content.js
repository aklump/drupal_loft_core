A big purpose of this module is to track anonymous users that appear \"spammy\" in order to block them from using your site.  It leverages the popular Honeypot module to flag a potential spammy user.  It uses the User restrictions module to then block the users, or generates a snippet of Apache code that can be pasted in the .htaccess file to block by IP address.  Expanding upon core's ability to block or unblock a user in a binary fashion, this module brings additional context to a blocked user, so you have an idea why the user was blocked.  Contexts include: user was robo-trapped, user is honeybear, user was marked spammy manually, user was manually converted from honeybear to spammy.  This module has a setting to record the IPs for authenticated users when they register, which augments the information stored about a user by Drupal core.  The module integrates with views making available the user IP and status, plus a few other fields.  It ships with a default view you may enable to see the augmented user info, or fields that you can add to other views as desired.  It also provides a setting that affects the login form, which will save the username of a user when they login, to a cookie in their browser.  When they visit the login form later, their username in the form is filled in from the cookie. Read more here.  How Are Users Flagged\/Blocked?  The Honepot Module Finds Them Suspicious  When the honeypot module traps a user, it passes that information on to Loft Core Users where they become a \"honeybear\".  This does not affect them yet, merely flags them as suspicious.  After review at \/admin\/config\/people\/loft-core-users, you can manually convert honeybears to spammy users with the following SQL against your database.  UPDATE loft_core_users SET status = 34 where status = 3;   Once converted the will be blocked from using the site.  The User Has Visited an URL They Shouldn't Have  If you see paths that are visited by obvious robots, you can register such paths in hook_menu or hook_menu_alter to use the page callback loft_core_users_robotrap_page_callback().  This sets up a trap that will immediately mark a user with the status LOFT_CORE_USERS_STATUS_ROBOT; they become robo-trapped.  Study the code for usage.  Programatically in Code  Simply mark a user as spammy using loft_core_users_mark_user_spammy.  This is the turn-key function to use.  Or for more control, set one of the following specific statuses on a user with loft_core_users_set_user_status.   LOFT_CORE_USERS_STATUS_ROBOT LOFT_CORE_USERS_STATUS_HONEYBEAR LOFT_CORE_USERS_STATUS_HONEYBEAR_MADE_SPAMMY LOFT_CORE_USERS_STATUS_SPAMMY   How are Anonymous User Tracked?  Authenticated users are considered unique by their Drupal user id.  Anonymous users, however are considered unique, by this module, by looking at their email address domain + their IP address.  As an example, if the website received three requests from anonymous users filling out forms with the following information, this module will see them all as a single user.  This is because all email addresses in the list share the same domain and the IP is the same from all three.       mail   IP       a@spammy.com   172.1.1.1     b@spammy.com   172.1.1.1     c@spammy.com   172.1.1.1     But in this next set, three database records will be created because the IP is different for two and non-existent for one, despite having the same base domain.       mail   IP       a@spammy.com   172.1.1.1     b@spammy.com   172.1.1.2     c@spammy.com   null     Lastly, take note that if the IP is the same but the domain differs, then three records will be tracked:       mail   IP       trouble@spammy.com   172.1.1.1     trouble@morespam.com   172.1.1.1     trouble@totalspam.com   172.1.1.1     What Exactly Does Blocked Mean?  If you have enabled the User Restrictions module, it will leverage the domain data collected by this module to block any user who is filling out the login form, the user regsitration form, or the user profile form, and whose email domain appears in the loft_core_users table as spammy. (Remember honeybears are not blocked yet).  If you have enabled the setting to automatically ban by IP, then new users will be locked out of your site at the Drupal level when their IP is associated with more than N spammy domains, where N is another module setting.  You may review and remove the ips banned in this way at \/admin\/config\/people\/ip-blocking.  Apache Level Blocking  You may routinely visit \/admin\/config\/people\/loft-core-users and export the apache snippet found there and paste it into your web root's .htaccess file.  This will block IPs at the apache level and reduce the load on your server and Drupal.  The admin form always contains all IP address in the database so you can just replace the entire code in .htaccess with the new snippet.  On that same form, you are asked how many spammy domains must share a single IP before they are included in the Apache list.  The logic is that if you see more than, say three domains, which have been marked as spammy coming from a single IP, you are probably safe to ban them from your site at the Apache level.  If you were to set this too low, you run this risk blocking valid users from ever accessing your site, or receiving assistence if wrongly blocked.  When a user is blocked by Drupal, they will see a link to the contact page where they can make a request to be unblocked.  But when they are blocked by apache, they have no way to contact you via website, as your site will never load for them.  They will see something like this:    Suggested Modules to Use  Honeypot  Honeypot rejections will be tracked as \"honey bears\" and can later be converted to \"spammy\" users.  This only works if the $_POST array contains the key mail.  An example is user_register_form, where this works nicely.  Honeybears can be found in the table loft_core_users with a status of LOFT_CORE_USERS_STATUS_HONEYBEAR.  Unless they are converted to spammy users LOFT_CORE_USERS_STATUS_HONEYBEAR_MADE_SPAMMY, they are not blocked from using your site.  User Restrictions  This module is not a dependecy, but without it blocking a user doesn't have any real effect.  Blocks users with an email address containing any domains that have been found as \"spammy\".  The list of domains are found in loft_core_users.  Contact Module  When a user is banned by drupal we will link them to the contact page, where they can ask to be unbanned.

This means that the user will have the option of checking a box that keeps them logged in via a cookie across sessions, that is when they close their browser.  But if they don't check the box they are logged out.      This is different from core Drupal, which keeps them logged in across sessions always; with no way to opt out.  So the persistent login module adds security for users who are sharing a computer.      Be sure to follow install instructions as settings.php needs to be modified.   This module has a means to remember the username so that it appears in the login form next time they try to log in.  Which is different from the above, but compilments it well.  In fact this module integrates with the Persistent Login module to leverage it's checkbox.  To enable this feature add the following to settings.php:  $conf['loft_core_users_remember_usernames'] = true;   If you enable this feature and you are not going to use Persistent Login, you can leverage a different switch by setting this variable in a hook_form_alter:  $form['#loft_core_users_remember_key'] = 'some_form_value_that_is_toggled';   By default, all usernames will be remembered if you enalbe this feature.
